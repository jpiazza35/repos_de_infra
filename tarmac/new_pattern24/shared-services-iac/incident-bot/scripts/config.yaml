  # Severities defined here will appear as options for each incident
  severities:

    sev2: 'This signifies a significant production degradation scenario impacting a large portion of users.'
    sev3: 'This signifies a minor production scenario that may or may not result in degradation. This situation is worth coordination to resolve quickly but does not indicate a critical loss of service for users.'
    sev4: 'This signifies an ongoing investigation. This incident has not been promoted to SEV3 yet, indicating there may be little to no impact, but the situation warrants a closer look. This is diagnostic in nature. This is the default setting for a new incident.'
