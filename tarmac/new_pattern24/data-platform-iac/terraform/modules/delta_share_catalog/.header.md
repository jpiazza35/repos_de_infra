# Terraform Module for Databricks Delta Share Catalog Provisioning
This Terraform module is designed to provision and manage a Databricks catalog created from a Delta Share that was shared with our organization, along with its associated resources. The key components and functionalities include:

- Catalog Creation: The databricks_catalog resource creates a Databricks catalog with specified properties like name, comment, isolation mode, and storage root.

- External Location Management: The module "external_location" manages external locations for the catalog, setting up necessary IAM roles and storage credentials.

- Granting Permissions: It manages permissions through databricks_grants for different roles like engineers, users, admins, and service principals. This includes privileges on the catalog, schemas, and volumes.

- Dynamic Grant Management: Utilizes dynamic blocks to efficiently manage and assign privileges based on various criteria and role definitions.

- Dependency Handling: Ensures proper sequence of resource creation and management through depends_on attributes, maintaining the integrity of the provisioning process.

- Sleep Resource: Includes a time_sleep resource to manage timing dependencies, ensuring proper sequencing of resource provisioning.

This module is highly configurable, with options to set environment prefixes, role prefixes, account IDs, and other variables to tailor the setup to specific requirements. It emphasizes security and fine-grained access control, making it suitable for complex and secure data environments.

The `share_name` and `provider_name` are provided by the organization that created the Delta Share to share with our organization. These are not configurable and should instead by retrieved by contacting the organization sharing the data.

Schema management is not supported. Access grants can only be applied to the entire catalog.
