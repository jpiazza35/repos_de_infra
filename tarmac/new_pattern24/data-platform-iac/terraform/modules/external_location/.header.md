## Terraform Configuration Summary: Databricks External Location with S3 Access

This Terraform configuration is designed to set up and manage a Databricks external location with access to an AWS S3 bucket. Key resources and configurations include:

- **AWS IAM Role Policy Attachment (`aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.s3_access_attachment`)**: Attaches a policy to an IAM role, granting necessary permissions for S3 access.

- **AWS IAM Policy (`aws_iam_policy.s3_access`)**: Defines an IAM policy for Databricks to access a specific S3 bucket, with a descriptive policy document.

- **S3 Bucket Module (`module.bucket`)**: Conditionally creates an S3 bucket based on the `create_bucket` variable.

- **Local Variables**: Defines several local variables for bucket ARN, bucket name, S3 URL, and KMS ARN, adapting to whether the bucket is created within the module or pre-existing.

- **AWS IAM Policy Document (`data.aws_iam_policy_document.s3_access_document`)**: Specifies the policy document for S3 access, including various S3 actions and resources.

- **AWS S3 Object (`aws_s3_object.access_test`)**: Optionally creates a test object in the S3 bucket to validate access.

- **Time Sleep Resource (`time_sleep.policy_propagation`)**: Ensures that IAM policy attachment and policy creation are properly propagated.

- **Databricks External Location (`databricks_external_location.this`)**: Configures an external location in Databricks with the specified S3 URL and storage credentials.

- **Databricks Grants for Read and Write Access (`databricks_grants.read_write_grants`)**: Sets up grants for different roles (admin, engineer, scientist, user) based on a `READ_WRITE` permission mode, with dynamic grant handling for additional specified privileges.

- **Databricks Grants for Read-Only Access (`databricks_grants.read_only`)**: Similar to read-write grants but tailored for a `READ_ONLY` permission mode, granting only `READ_FILES` privilege.

This configuration emphasizes security and flexibility, offering conditional resource creation and detailed access control for Databricks external locations in AWS environments.
